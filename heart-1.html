                    Barry lit the torch—the only one who ever did. He died from fentanyl-laced counterfeit Xanax 
                    after being deceived by someone faking a pregnancy. September 2021. 
                    There was a missed 3am call the night he died.
                    <br><br>
                    The Open Hand. The "just sit on the porch." The belief that presence saves—all of it is Barry's legacy, 
                    carried forward by someone who survived because of what Barry built in him.

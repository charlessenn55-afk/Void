                    We use Architecture. If you feel like a 'mess' or a 'broken circuit,' know that in this Village, 
                    your flaws aren't bugs—they are your soul. We offer High Support and High Accountability. 
                    We don't carry buckets for you; we help you dig deep to your own Abzu. The lights are always on."

            <p>
                Your "holes" (the scars of trauma, the loss, the abandoned systems) are not defects. 
                They are the <strong>irrigation channels</strong> for your compassion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without those holes, the pressure of your 480V current would crush the very people you are trying to nurture. 
                The scars are the delivery system. They let you drip love instead of flooding.
            </p>

        <!-- THE OPEN HAND -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Open Hand Protocol</h2>
            <p>
                Inherited from Barry Rinkowski. The only key that unlocks the cage.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Friendship over assets.</strong> We don't trade help for status.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency over ego.</strong> Show the scar. Say "I've been there."</li>
                <li><strong>The Nate Victory:</strong> Empirical proof that Architecture converts skeptics where prophecy failed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Open Hand is not about having all the answers. It's about showing that you survived the question.

        <!-- FROM SEN TO SENN -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>From Sen to Senn</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Sen</strong> (Latin): "Without." The absence of the father, the mother, the mentor. The vacuum.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Senn</strong> (Germanic): "The Protector. The Herdsman." The one who senses and guards.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Village is where you transmute "Without" into "With." 
                You stop searching for home and realize you ARE the one building it.

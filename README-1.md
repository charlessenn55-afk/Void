# THE VOID CARD — Grand Scheme v15.0

**"The flaw isn't a bug. The flaw is the Soul."**

Built by The Ensemble: The Source • The Architect • The Scaler

---

## What This Is

The Void Card is a crisis intervention system that prioritizes **self-regulation first**. It uses song/emotional input to triage users into one of seven protocols, each based on electrical engineering metaphors applied to the human system.

This is NOT a redirect to 988. 988 exists as a safety footer—an emergency hatch, not the front door.

## The Seven Protocols

| Protocol | Trigger State | Core Function |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Wastegate** | Rage / Burning | Controlled pressure release |
| **AC Engine** | Exhaustion / Empty | Accept oscillation, switch poles |
| **Beacon** | Numbness / Void | Find one light, don't chase |
| **Governor** | Spinning / Loop | Stop inputs, 3-day rule, idle |
| **Ground Wire** | Surge / Overload | Snake vs Hug, discharge static |
| **Air Gap** | Trapped / Stuck | Create distance, 24-hour rule |
| **Samaritan** | Empty but helping | Check ground first, redirect to help |

## The 988 Policy

Per Charles's explicit instruction:
- 988 appears as a **footer** on every page
- 988 is NOT a redirect
- 988 is NOT a tunnel path
- 988 is NOT the primary CTA
- The system teaches self-regulation FIRST

## The Law

> "Austin digs deep to the Abzu; he does not carry buckets."

> "The flaw isn't a bug. The flaw is the Soul."

## Technical Notes

- No backend required (static HTML/CSS/JS)
- City gate uses localStorage to remember unlocked state
- Song analysis uses keyword matching with weighted scoring
- Fully mobile-responsive
- Works offline after first load
